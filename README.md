# E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built with **Dash** and **Plotly Express** to explore sales and product data from an e-commerce dataset.

The application loads the dataset directly from Google Drive and displays a series of interactive charts that help identify sales patterns, seasonal trends, and category behavior based on variables such as price, quantity sold, gender, and season.
